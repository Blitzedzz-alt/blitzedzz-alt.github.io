  <h1>Exposing WH!TE / R!D / fy1white for Lying About Their Age</h1>

  <h2>1. The Original Claim: 12 Years Old</h2>
  <p>When I first started talking to <strong>WH!TE</strong> (aka <strong>R!D</strong> or <strong>fy1white</strong>) in early <strong>2025</strong>, he told me he was <strong>12 years old</strong>.</p>
  <p>This wasn’t just a passing joke — he said it multiple times, and everything about how he acted lined up. I had no reason to question it.</p>
  <p>I don't have screenshots of the exact age claim, but he later admitted to calling it a "joke."</p>
  <img src="screenshots/it was a joke.png" alt="It was a joke response" class="evidence">

  <div class="quote">(And yes, he tried brushing it off as a “joke” 💔 but that’s not how jokes work when you keep saying it seriously.)</div>

  <h2>2. Mid-Year Claim: Actually I’m 13</h2>
  <p>Later this year, he randomly changed his story to being <strong>13 years old</strong>. No warning. No birthday. Just randomly “13 now.”</p>
  <p>Okay... maybe his birthday passed? Well — that’s when it gets worse.</p>

  <h2>3. Current Claim: Suddenly 14?</h2>
  <div class="quote">“I’m 14.”<br>(Said mid-2025, with zero explanation)</div>
  <img src="screenshots/im 14 bro.png" alt="I'm 14 now message" class="evidence">

  <p>So to summarize: in <strong>one single year</strong>, he said he was <strong>12</strong>, then <strong>13</strong>, and now <strong>14</strong>.</p>
  <p>Bro aged two years in less than six months 💀</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maybe he’s lying to manipulate situations?</li>
    <li>Maybe he’s lying to cover up who he was dating?</li>
    <li>Or maybe he just can’t keep his lies straight</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Either way — that’s a <strong>huge red flag</strong> 💯</p>

  <h2>4. What This Says</h2>
  <p>Lying about your age online isn’t just cringe — it’s <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
  <p>It affects trust, boundaries, and how safe others feel talking to you. And trying to pretend he never said “I’m 12”? That’s just <strong>gaslighting</strong>.</p>

  <h2>5. Why I’m Posting This</h2>
  <p>This isn’t drama — this is clarity. I’m not gonna let someone twist the story and make me seem crazy for pointing out a timeline that <strong>literally makes no sense</strong>.</p>
  <p>If someone goes from 12 in January → 13 in April → 14 in July? That’s not a birthday. That’s a <strong>timeline error</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Also:</strong> He was dating a 14-year-old during this. So if he was really 12 at the start, that’s not okay. If he’s pretending to be older to cover it up — that’s worse.</p>

  <h2>6. Raiding My Server Like a Clown 🤡 (Antisemitic warning)</h2>
  <p>After I posted all this, bro got <strong>mad pressed</strong> and raided my Discord server with invite spam 🤣</p>
  <img src="screenshots/im gonna raid your server.png" alt="Before raiding my server" class="evidence">
  <img src="screenshots/the message it was spamming.png" alt="Spamming this message" class="evidence">
  <div class="quote">this is soo tuff its totally not <strong>legit childish behavior</strong>😐</div>

  <p>You just exposed yourself harder. GG.</p>


  <h2>7. Racism (Him tryna act gangster 💔)</h2>
  <p>This part's not directly age-related but proves the immaturity even more.</p>
  <p>He was out here tryna act “gangster” — casually dropping slurs and pretending that makes him cool.</p>
  <img src="screenshots/im cool because i say the n word.png" alt="Fake gangster behavior" class="evidence"> 
  
  <h2>8. He didn't learn his lesson AND ignored the lesson.. 😭</h2>
  <p>He a DAY later decided to get a NEW gf, Like bro didn't u learn your lesson</p>
  <p>Also when my GF was tryna talk some sense into bro he blocked her💔</p>
  <div class="quote">The first screenshot he was spamming me with stickers (I forgot to block him on tiktok) 😭</div>
  <img src="screenshots/After he spammed me.jpg" alt="After he spammed me.." class="evidence"> 
  <img src="screenshots/Admitted telling him he shouldn't.jpg" alt="Tryna tell him why he shouldnt" class="evidence"> 
  <img src="screenshots/We did tell his gf to break up prolly bc hes underage.jpg" alt="We told his gf to break up bc hes underage" class="evidence"> 
  <div class="quote">The reason why his ex broke up with him is because we told her his age <strong>Which is prolly for the best</strong>😛</div>
  <p>The reason why he blocked my gf:</p>
  <img src="screenshots/blocked my gf.jpg" alt="Blocked my gf because she talked sense into him💔🥀" class="evidence"> 
  <p>The ONLY reason why he blocked her is because she was talking sense into him</p>


  <div class="tldr">
    <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>WH!TE / R!D / fy1white told me he was <strong>12</strong> at the start of <strong>2025</strong></li>
      <li>Later said he was <strong>13</strong></li>
      <li>Now says he’s <strong>14</strong> — all in the <strong>same year</strong></li>
      <li>That's a <strong>whole identity crisis</strong>, not a birthday</li>
      <li>Dated a 14 y/o while possibly being 12 or 13</li>
      <li>Raided my server outta rage 💀</li>
      <li>Tries acting tough online while casually dropping slurs</li>
      <li>If he lies about his age <strong>this much</strong>, you can’t trust anything he says</li>
    </ul>
